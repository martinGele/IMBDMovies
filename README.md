# Android IMDb API Internship Project

## Overview

This project is part of my learning journey during my internship. It is an Android application that interacts with the IMDb API to fetch and display movie data. The goal is to deepen my understanding of Android development and working with third-party APIs.

## Features

- **Search Movies**: Search for movies using the IMDb API.
- **Movie Details**: View detailed information about selected movies, including synopsis, ratings, and cast.
- **Favorites**: Mark movies as favorites for easy access.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for different screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Framework**: Android
- **API**: IMDb API
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Networking**: Retrofit for API calls
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt
- **JSON Parsing**: Moshi
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose for UI components

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Add your IMDb API key to the `local.properties` file:
    ```properties
    imdb_api_key=your_api_key
    ```
4. Build and run the project on an Android device or emulator.

## How to Use

1. Launch the app.
2. Use the search bar to find movies by title.
3. Tap on a movie to view its details.
4. Mark movies as favorites by tapping the favorite icon.

## Learning Objectives

- **Android Fundamentals**: Deepen understanding of Android components such as Activities, Fragments, and ViewModels.
- **API Integration**: Learn how to work with third-party APIs and handle network requests.
- **Modern Android Development**: Gain experience with Jetpack libraries like Compose, Hilt, and more.
- **Best Practices**: Implement clean code practices, proper error handling, and efficient resource management.
